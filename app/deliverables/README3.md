> **Deliverable 3:** To further develop the app I used a `MEAN` ( MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS) stack of technologies. We will also be using bootstrap to make the UI responsive. The Front-end will be in Angular which is located in `MusiQ`. And the database and the back-end can be found in`backend/database/mongodb.js`and`backend/src/api.js`

### Introduction:

This is a basic MEAN stack setup of the web application and has limited functionality. The source code are: [Frontend](/MusiQ/README.md), [BackEnd](/backend/src/api.js), [Database](backend/database/mongodb.js).

### Server Technology

The server or the backend technology for used is written in NodeJS with the ExpressJS framework [BackEnd](/backend/src/api.js).

#### Database Technology

I used the MEAN stack simply to get some hands on experience on learning to use NOSQL. And that is why the Database Technology I used for this project is MongoDB [BackEnd](/backend/src/api.js)

#### Automated Test FrameWork

Angular uses Jasmine Testing Framework as the default. which uses Karma as a test runner and displayed in the browser.

### Deplyment Upgrade Script

### Refined HTML/CSS + UI Design System

### Front-End Mock Interactivity Using JavaScript

### Installation

Simply copy the repo in your desktop and open the HTML file from `app/src/index.html`. This will run the web application. A proper build tool will be deployed with the next deliverable.
