#### Introduction:

This is a simple music streaming applicaiton with the basic design and layout to make streaming music easier.

#### Platform:

The application will be designed as a website or web applicaiton since it will enable us to use all the content we learned in the course. Also because a website can be accessed from any device as long as it has a browser installed.

#### Domain:

The domain of this project is audio/music streaming. The users will have access to the music through their devices and the creators can add new music to the bucket in the cloud so that the users can surf.

#### Technologies:

We will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end. The backend will be programmed in NodeJS, while the data and audio files will be served on Amazon cloud services. This is a basic set up we might move on to using opensource frameworks, libraries, and build tools like Angular, Bootstrap, and Gulpto ease up the designing and staging process so that we have a better and enhanced view of the User Interface and keep an update of the build process so that it does not ship out with bugs with every commit. This will be solely done to help me as the student have a better workflow.

#### Installation:

To build the project clone the repository by runing the following commands:

`git clone "repository url"`
